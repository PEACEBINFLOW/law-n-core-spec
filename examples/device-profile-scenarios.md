## Phone-First Scenario

- Law-N sees a 5G-capable phone.
- GLCS reports supported G-layers and capabilities.
- CLSI keeps the workload at the edge and prioritizes:
  - low latency
  - low battery impact

## Computer-Only Scenario

- Law-N sees a device connected via Wi-Fi/fiber.
- No radio/5G context.
- CLSI may choose different routing and edge nodes.
