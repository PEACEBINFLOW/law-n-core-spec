# Law-N Glossary

**CLFI**  
Current Layered Functional Internet — the legacy TCP/IP + HTTP + API stack.

**Law-N Node**  
A logical entity that runs Law-N rules over signals and routes (might be in a tower, satellite, router, or cloud edge).

**Signal Identity (LSIP)**  
A structured identity for a signal derived from:
- device fingerprint
- frequency band
- G-layer (1G–6G+)
- location / tower context
- time window

**Pattern**  
A description of how a signal behaves over time (e.g. strength, latency, jitter, error rate).

**G-Layer**  
The generation layer (1G/2G/3G/4G/5G/6G) with its own physical and protocol rules.

**CLSI**  
Cloud Layer Signal Interface — a cloud model aware of signal topology and Law-N state.

**N-SQL**  
Network SQL — query language for live network state under Law-N.

**N-LLM**  
Network Language Model — a model trained on signal patterns instead of human text.
