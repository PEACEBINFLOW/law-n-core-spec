# CLSI Interface Spec (Draft)

This spec explains how Law-N nodes expose state upwards into **CLSI**.

- What metadata CLSI can query:
  - tower load
  - route patterns
  - device capabilities
- How CLSI returns workload placement decisions:
  - which edge to run on
  - which signals to prefer or avoid
