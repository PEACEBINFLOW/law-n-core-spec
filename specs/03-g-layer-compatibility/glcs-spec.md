# GLCS — G-Layer Compatibility Standard (Draft)

GLCS defines how 1G/2G/3G/4G/5G/6G and future generations are normalized into one programmable interface.

- Each G-layer exposes:
  - capabilities
  - limits
  - cost/energy profile
- Law-N uses GLCS to:
  - pick which G-layer to use
  - translate a single “intent” into multiple radio realities
