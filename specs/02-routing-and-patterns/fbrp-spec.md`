# FBRP — Frequency-Based Routing Protocol (Draft)

**Status:** Draft  
**Version:** 0.1.0  
**Author:** Peace Thabiwa  
**Last Updated:** 2025-11-25

FBRP defines how Law-N routes based on **frequency and patterns**, not just hops.

- Input: LSIP IDs + pattern constraints (latency, reliability, energy, etc.)
- Output: a route composed of towers, satellites, and links that satisfy those patterns.

Future versions of this doc will define:

- the route description format
- negotiation steps between Law-N nodes
- how N-LLMs can suggest or modify routes
